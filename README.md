# Project-4

Employed web scraping techniques with Selenium to extract nationwide used vehicle listings data from Facebook Marketplace. Used NLP (Natural Language Processing) to classify listings as "rebuilt" or "clean" based on their description. Stored the data in a SQL database for efficient management and developed an API using Flask to enable seamless data retrieval. The collected data was further presented in a user-friendly interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard, providing users with a visually appealing and accessible way to explore the information from Facebook Marketplace.
